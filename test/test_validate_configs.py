"""This test ensures that config files for non-development environments
(in billing/conf/configs, which get copied to billing/ during deployment)
don't become invalid as the config file schema changes. Better to
catch this before deployment than after. It only checks conformity to the
schema, so it obviously doesn't guarantee that the contents of the files are
correct.
